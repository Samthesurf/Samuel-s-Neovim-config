# My Neovim configuration

I have 73 plugins downloaded.
The journey of configuring has been very interesting, it has also been headache inducing.
# Colorscheme

I have gone through several colorschemes, and I have found these 3 to be the most interesting:
a) Kanagawa
b) Ayu
c) Monet

My colorscheme of choice is *Monet*
